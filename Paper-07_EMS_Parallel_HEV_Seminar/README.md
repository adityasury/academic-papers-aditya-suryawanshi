## Abstract
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) contribute significantly to reduced fuel
consumption and emissions. This work focuses on the development and comparison
of energy management strategies for a mild parallel hybrid electric vehicle.
Both rule-based and dynamic programming-based strategies are implemented using
MATLAB/Simulink and the Quasi-Static Simulation (QSS) Toolbox. The study evaluates
fuel consumption and battery state-of-charge sustainment under standard driving
cycles such as NEDC and FTP-75. Results indicate that dynamic programming provides
better fuel economy compared to rule-based control, though at a higher computational
cost, highlighting trade-offs for real-time applications.
